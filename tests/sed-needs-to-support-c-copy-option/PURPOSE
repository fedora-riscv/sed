Bug summary: sed needs to support -c/--copy option

Description:

Description of problem:
sed on bind-mounted files fails in rename step.  In previous versions this was fixed by using -c/--copy functionality which appears to have been removed in 4.2.1-4.

Bind mounts are used in stateless systems for persistent data.  

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
4.2.1-4

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. touch file1 file2
2. mount --bind file1 file2
3. echo "test" > file1
4. sed -i "s/test/fail/g" file2
  
Actual results:
sed: cannot rename ./sedfnZpvY: Device or resource busy


Expected results:
sed script completes. 

Additional info:
As of 4.2.1-4, the -c/--copy options did not exist at all.  Using them resulted in the printing of the help message.  Using 4.2.1-5 from koji reintroduced the -c/--copy option support, but the above sed command still fails.
