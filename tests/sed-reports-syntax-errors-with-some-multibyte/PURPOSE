Bug summary: sed reports syntax errors with some multibyte characters

Description:

Description of problem:

Using a multibyte character that ends with 0x5c (backslash) can cause sed to report syntax errors.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): sed-4.1.5-5


How reproducible:  Always


Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start with your shell in a UTF-8 locale, eg en-US.UTF-8 (you can probably do this in a different locale, but it definitely works if you start in a UTF-8 locale).

2. Run the follow commands to construct a sed script:

   U2010=$(echo -ne '\x20\x10' | iconv -f ucs-2be)
   echo "echo '$U2010' | sed 's/$U2010/hyphen/g'" | iconv -t gbk > /tmp/script

3. Run the shell script in a locale that uses the gbk character set:

   LC_ALL=zh_CN.gbk sh /tmp/script 2>&1 | iconv -f gbk
  
Actual results:
   The script reports an error:

    sed：-e 表达式 #1，字符 13：unterminated `s' command

Expected results:

   The single word "hyphen"


Additional info:

The error arises because the character U+2010 (HYPHEN) is encoded as \xa9\x5c in the gbk encoding.  Sed sees the "\x5c" as a backslash escaping the following character which, in this case, is the "/" that we hope is going to terminate the pattern; it doesn't and so we get a syntax error.

Of course, this is just one character in one encoding.  There are likely to be many others and this is just one example.   I have another example for SJIS, (U+8868) but SJIS isn't a good encoding to use for reporting bugs :-).
